# Excel Data Manipulation - Robot Process Automation using UiPath Platform

## Introduction

This project is an example of Robot Process Automation (RPA) using the UiPath Platform to perform data manipulation on an Excel file. The robot performs various operations on the input Excel file and generates a new workbook file with the processed data.

## Operations Performed

1. **Converting Age and Annual Salary Columns:**
   The robot converts the Age column and Annual Salary column to contain only digits, removing any non-numeric characters or letters.

2. **Sorting the Table:**
   The robot sorts the table based on a specified column, allowing for better data organization.

3. **Removing Duplicates:**
   The robot removes any duplicate rows from the Excel file, ensuring data integrity.

4. **Calculating Age Average and Summing Annual Salary:**
   The robot calculates the average of the Age column and the sum of the Annual Salary column. Additionally, it counts the number of males and females in the dataset. The results are then stored in a new sheet in the workbook.

5. **Styling Headers:**
   The robot applies bold formatting to the headers in the processed Excel file for better readability.

## Supervision
